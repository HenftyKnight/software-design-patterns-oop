Hello Everyone, 
what if I say, that the code you write should apply not only to the
problem at hand but also to future problems which you don't have any
notion about?
We all know the value of design experience. How many times have you had design
déjà-vu—that feeling that you've solved a problem before but not knowing exactly
where or how? If you could remember the details of the previous problem and how
you solved it, then you could reuse the experience instead of rediscovering it.
The purpose of this presentaion is to get you familiar with such design patterns in 
with OO software.
The goal of these design patterns was to capture design experience in a form that people can use effectively.
To this end we have documented some of the most important design patterns and
present them as a powerpoint presentation.
