Structural Design Patterns provides relationship between objects

1) Adapter    : Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
-->  A special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

-->  The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.
     Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods.
     Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a 
     format and order that the second object expects.

--> One advantage of the Adapter Pattern is that you don’t need to change the existing class or interface. 
    By introducing a new class, which acts as an adapter between the interface and the class, you avoid any 
    changes to the existing code. That limits the scope of your changes to your software component and avoids 
    any changes and side-effects in other components or applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Bridge     : Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
-->  This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge which makes the 
     functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes. 
     Both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting each other.

-->  The bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed 
     independently and the client code can access only the Abstraction part without 
     being concerned about the Implementation part.

-->  The abstraction is an interface or abstract class and the implementor is also an interface or abstract class.
     The abstraction contains a reference to the implementor. Children of the abstraction are referred to as refined 
     abstractions, and children of the implementor are concrete implementors. 
     Since we can change the reference to the implementor in the abstraction, we are able to change the abstraction’s 
     implementor at run-time. Changes to the implementor do not affect client code.

-->  Abstraction – core of the bridge design pattern and defines the crux. Contains a reference to the implementer.
     Refined Abstraction – Extends the abstraction takes the finer detail one level below. Hides the finer elements 
     from implemetors.
     Implementer – It defines the interface for implementation classes. This interface does not need to correspond 
     directly to the abstraction interface and can be very different. Abstraction imp provides an implementation in 
     terms of operations provided by Implementer interface.

-->  Concrete Implementation – Implements the above implementer by providing concrete implementation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Composite  : Takes a group of objects into a single object.
-->  Composite pattern is one of the most widely used patterns in the industry 
     and addresses a very significant and subtle problem.

-->  It is used whenever the user wants to treat the individual object in the same way as the collection of those 
     individual objects for e.g you might want to consider a page from the copy as same as the whole copy which is 
     basically a collection of the pages or if you want to create a hierarchy of something where you might want to 
     consider the whole thing as the object .

-->  This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects. This class provides ways to modify its 
     group of same objects.

-->  But in simple words, the Composite Design Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern with a goal to treat the group 
     of objects in the same manner as a single object.

-->  “Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies”: A part-whole hierarchy is composed of 
     smaller individual objects called Parts and larger objects called Wholes that are aggregation of Parts. What the 
     pattern says is- for part-whole hierarchies, create tree structures to represent relationships between the Parts and Wholes.

-->  “Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly”: This means that a client should be 
     able to apply the same operations over both aggregation of objects (Wholes) and individual objects (Parts).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Decorator  : Allows for an object’s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
--> Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. 
    This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

--> This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality 
    keeping class methods signature intact.

--> In other words, the client has the freedom to create an object and then extend it by adding a variety of “features” 
    to it. A good analogy to simplify this pattern is: “Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box”.

--> The Decorator pattern provides a more flexible way to add responsibilities to objects than can be had with
    static (multiple) inheritance. With decorators, responsibilities can be added and removed at run-time simply by attaching 
    and detaching them.

--> In contrast, inheritance requires creating a new class for each additional
    responsibility.This gives rise to many classes and increases the complexity of a system.

--> A decorator is different from an adapter in that a decorator only changes an object's responsibilities, not its interface; 
    an adapter will give an object a completely new interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Facade     : Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
--> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

--> Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity. A common design
    goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems. One
    way to achieve this goal is to introduce a facade object that provides a single,
    simplified interface to the more general facilities of a subsystem.

--> Reducing compilation dependencies is vital in large software systems. You
    want to save time by minimizing recompilation when subsystem classes change.

--> Reducing compilation dependencies with facades can limit the recompilation
    needed for a small change in an important subsystem. A facade can also
    simplify porting systems to other platforms, because it's less likely that
    building one subsystem requires building all other

--> It doesn't prevent applications from using subsystem classes if they need
    to.Thus you can choose between ease of use and generality.   

--> Clients communicate with the subsystem by sending requests to Facade, which
    forwards them to the appropriate subsystem object(s). Although the
    subsystem objects perform the actual work, the facade may have to do work
    of its own to translate its interface to subsystem interfaces.
    Clients that use the facade don't have to access its subsystem objects
    directly

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6) Flyweight  : Reduces the cost of complex object models.
--> Flyweight is a structural design pattern that allows programs to support vast 
    quantities of objects by keeping their memory consumption low.

--> In Flyweight pattern we use a HashMap that stores reference to the object which 
    have already been created, every object is associated with a key. Now when a client wants 
    to create an object, he simply has to pass a key associated with it and if the object has 
    already been created we simply get the reference to that object else it creates a new 
    object and then returns it reference to the client.

--> The idea behind Flyweight pattern is sharable object.

--> The Flyweight uses sharing to support large numbers of objects efficiently. 
    Modern web browsers use this technique to prevent loading same images twice. 
    When browser loads a web page, it traverse through all images on that page. 
    Browser loads all new images from Internet and places them the internal cache. 
    For already loaded images, a flyweight object is created, which has some unique 
    data like position within the page, but everything else is referenced to the cached one.

--> In other words, the state of an object can be decomposed with respect to a group of 
    objects as an intrinsic state and an extrinsic state, where the intrinsic state is the 
    intersection of the states of all objects of the group and the extrinsic state is the 
    difference of the state of the object and the intrinsic state.

--> extrinsic - state that belongs to the context of the object (external) or unique to that instance

    intrinsic - state that naturally belongs to the 'FlyWeight' object and thus should be permanent or 
    immutable (internal) or context free.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) Proxy      : Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity
--> Proxy means ‘in place of’, representing’ or ‘in place of’ or ‘on behalf of’ are literal 
    meanings of proxy and that directly explains Proxy Design Pattern.

--> A class represents functionality of another class. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern.

--> A very simple real life scenario is our college internet, which restricts few site access. 
    The proxy first checks the host you are connecting to, if it is not part of restricted site list, 
    then it connects to the real internet.

--> Remote Proxies : They are responsible for representing the object located remotely. 

--> Virtual Proxies: These proxies will provide some default and instant results if the real object is supposed to 
     take sometime to produce results.

--> Protection Proxy : If an application does not have access to some resource then such proxies 
    will talk to the objects in applications that have access to that resource and then get the result back.

--> Smart Proxy: A smart proxy provides additional layer of security by interposing specific actions when 
    the object is accessed. An example can be to check if the real object is locked before it is accessed 
    to ensure that no other object can change it.
